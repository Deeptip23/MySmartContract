# Land Registry Smart Contract
This project is a blockchain-based Land Registry system built using Ethereum smart contracts.
It ensures transparent, secure, and tamper-proof ownership records of land properties by leveraging decentralized technology.
Traditional land record systems are prone to fraud, data manipulation, and lack of transparency.
This project aims to eliminate intermediaries and provide a trustless system for land ownership verification.
The Land Registry smart contract stores land ownership data on the Ethereum blockchain.
Only authorized users can register or transfer land ownership, ensuring security and immutability.
- Register new land properties
- Transfer land ownership securely
- View land ownership details
- Immutable and transparent records
- Role-based access control
- Solidity
- Ethereum Blockchain
- Remix IDE / Hardhat / Truffle
- MetaMask
- GitHub
Main functions in the smart contract:
- registerLand(): Registers a new land property
- transferOwnership(): Transfers land ownership
- getLandDetails(): Fetches land information
1. Open Remix IDE
2. Upload the smart contract file
3. Compile the contract using Solidity compiler
4. Deploy the contract using JavaScript VM or MetaMask
5. Interact with the contract functions
- Integration with frontend (React / Web3.js)
- NFT-based land ownership
- Government authority verification
- IPFS for document storage
